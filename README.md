# opengl_fps
Originally started out as an attempt to remake some sort of FPS game inspired by Doom, designing and creating everything from the ground up around OpenGL and C++. I got a few things working which I'm pretty proud of, but honestly I can now understand why most games are multi-people projects or span multiple years for a single person to develop. 

There's several things I wasn't able to quite figure out such as creating levels with different height meshes and how to import a model to match the heightmap. But combined with the bouncing around of trying to implement various functions without a good roadmap or planning made this project hard and difficult to pick back up. Maybe next time I'll plan better and focus on an MVP.
